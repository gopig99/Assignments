1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them
A: True,False are the two values of boolean data type. True and False. In code, 2<1 is False 2==2 is True

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators
A:AND,OR,NOT

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate )
A: AND
   True and True is True
   True and False is False
   False and True is False
   False and False is False
   OR
   True or True is True
   True or False is True
   False or True is True
   False or False is False
   NOT
   True not is False 
   False not is True

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5> 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)
A: False, False, True, False, False, True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
A: equals to,not equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, less than or equal to.
   (==,!=,>,>=,<,<=)
6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators.Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
A:The “=” is an assignment operator is used to assign the value on the right to the variable on the left. The '==' operator checks whether the two given operands are equal or not.
   a=3 # Assigning operator that stores 3 value in a variable a
   if a==3:#comparing values of a varible value and 3
      print(a==3)  

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
   print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
   print('bacon')
else:
   print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')
A: In Python, code block refers to a collection of code that is in the same block or indent. This is most commonly found in classes, functions, and loops.
spam = 0  
if spam == 10:  
    print('eggs')  # block 1
if spam > 5:  
    print('bacon')  # block 2
else:  
    print('ham')  # block 3
print('spam')  
print('spam')

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
A:
a=input()
if a=='1':
    print('hello')
elif a=='2':
    print('howdy')
else:
    print('Greetings!')


9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press
A:Ctrl + c

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue
A: break leaves the loop completely and executes the statements after the loop.
   continue leaves the current iteration and executes with the next value in the loop.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)
A:
The range(10) call range from 0 to 9 (but not include 10)
The range (0,10) explicitly tells the loop to start at 0
The range(0,10,1) explicitly tells the loop to increase the variable by 1 on each iteration

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
A:
using for loop
for i in range(1,11):
    print(i, end=" ")

using while loop
i=1
while i<=10:
    print(i, end=" ")
    i+=1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam
A:spam.bacon()
